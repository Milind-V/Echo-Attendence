# Echo-Attendence

Echo-based Autonomous Real Time Attendance System in DoS protocol (Data over Sound) using Quiet Modem Project.(Term Project)

### Abstract

Overcoming the difficulties of manual attendance, the Echo-based Real-time (E.A.R.) Attendance System provides an effective and efficient way for recording and maintaining attendance of students in an institute on daily basis. The conventional method of taking attendance by calling names or signing is very time-consuming, tedious, and insecure. It left a lot of holes in effectiveness, such as missing records, paper consumption, tardy reports, etc. The attendance is recorded for a Echo receiving device(Microphone) from a Echo sending device (Speaker) and all the records are saved in a Real-Time Cloud Database. Data is encoded in unique frequency at the transmitter’s end and sent over sound, which then decoded at receiver’s end and attendance is marked for the day in the cloud database. Attendance recording process is one-shot where, every receiver’s attendance is marked at the same time unlike facial recognition systems or fingerprint based attendance system. EAR system uses liquid DSR (Software-Defined Radio Digital Signal Processing) to transmit data from the transimtter’s end and to process received data at the receiver’s end. Moreover, the proposed system eases out the task of capturing specimen of the students (such as fingerprints, facial images, etc.), required for the dataset so as to train the model in case of other autonomous attendance systems and hence, saves time and effort by completely eliminating human intervention and ensures high reliability as well.
